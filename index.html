            Hello! My name is Athena Phommivong, I'm 21, and I'm a third year student at the University of Iowa. 
            I live in Davenport, Iowa, and I have been a three year commuter to all of my in-person classes since the pandemic in 2020.
            Since I have lived at home for the past few years of college, I mainly worked as a nail technician at Nails De Vie in Bettendorf, Iowa to make money for my future expenses in college. 
            In the past, I have worked as a farmer's market seller in 2017 for the summer, worked in reception for Wehr Family Chiropractics in 2022, and worked as an assistant for David Williams, a Farmers Insurance Agent, also in the summer, in 2022. 
            Throughout my time in Wehr Chiropractics, I utilized my knowledge from my classes at Tippie and have created Excel spreadsheets that had made their work load easier to manage, and faster for their accountants to process. 
            I found that their older ways of documenting their payroll and collections were inefficient, so I stepped forward and volunteered to create new spreadsheets for them to use before I left for my 2022 Fall semester at Iowa.
